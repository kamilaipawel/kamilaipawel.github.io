        The nearest airport is <a href="http://www.airport.lodz.pl/en/index.html" target="blank">Lodz Airport</a> and there is a direct flight from Stansted on Saturday returning on Monday
      </p>
      <p>
        Hotel accommodation after the reception is provided by us.
        The rooms are in the hotel run by the restaurant, which is close but isn't very big. In order to fit everyone we're planning to put 4 people per room. We also have a limited number of rooms on Saturday-Sunday so if you wish to arrive earlier please <a href="#contact">contact us.</a>
      </p>

      <h1 id="customs">Polish wedding customs</h1>
      <p>
        Meals, snacks, vodka and all other drinks are provided by us and unlimited.
        We recognize that guests have different food preferences and potential allergies therefore we'd like to invite all of you to fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezQ-r3VY4KcZwW1PO9K8iJDLE8rYAIRDCc06ENo8QnDz3tuQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="blank">RSVP survey</a> and tell us.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no gift lists and we tend to give each other cash equivalents accompanied with flowers or wine. Flowers fade and we couldn't possibly drink all that wine so instead we invite all guests to bring a small cuddly toy so we can donate them to the single mother care center in Lodz.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a custom of playing games we call "oczepiny" at midnight. As you can see from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJ4XXumU0Q">Exhibit A</a> they make absolutely no sense ... Therefore we decided to have just a very limited version of it and the participation is voluntary. This should give you enough tradition without too much embarrassment.
